Assignment: End-to-End Influencer Deal Platform
Goal

Build a full-stack web application that helps a brand/marketing team manage influencer deals from end to end:

1. Find influencers
2. Reach out & negotiate
3. Request/store rate cards
4. Create offers & contracts
5. Track campaign deliverables
6. Provide dashboards & ROI analytics

The system must be publicly deployed (e.g., Vercel/Netlify/Firebase Hosting for frontend, Render/Fly/Railway/Cloud Run for backend, Postgres as DB).
A working URL + demo credentials are required.
